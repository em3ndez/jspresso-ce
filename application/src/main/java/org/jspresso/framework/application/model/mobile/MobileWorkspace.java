/**
 * A workspace is an group of functional application modules. You may decide
 * arbitrarily how to group modules into workspaces but a good approach might be
 * to design the workspaces based on roles (i.e. business activities). This
 * helps to clearly separates tasks-unrelated modules and eases authorization
 * management since a workspace can be granted or forbidden as a whole by
 * Jspresso security.
 * <p>
 * Workspaces might be graphically represented differently depending on the UI
 * technology used. For instance, the Swing and ULC channels use a MDI UI in
 * which each workspace is represented as an internal frame (document). On the
 * other hand, Flex and qooxdoo channels represent workspaces stacked in an
 * accordion. Whatever the graphical representation is, there is at most one
 * workspace active at a time for a user session - either the active (focused)
 * internal frame or the expanded accordion section.
