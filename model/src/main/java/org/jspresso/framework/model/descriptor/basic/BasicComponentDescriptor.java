/**
 * This type of descriptor is used to describe :
 * <ul>
 * <li>structures that are to be reused but don't have enough focus for being
 * considered as entities. For instance {@code MoneyAmount} component could
 * be composed of a decimal and a reference to a {@code Money} entity. This
 * structure could then be reused in other elements of the domain like an
 * {@code Invoice} or an {@code Article}. Jspresso terminology for
 * these type of structures is <i>&quot;Inline Component&quot;</i>.</li>
 * <li>arbitrary models, that even come from outside of Jspresso (an external
 * library for instance). Describing an arbitrary component allows for seamless
 * usage in the Jspresso view binding architecture. Note that in that case, all
 * behavioural properties like lifecycle interceptors or service delegates are
 * ignored since none of the model behaviour is handled by Jspresso.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Both types of components described above must conform to the <i>Java
 * Beans</i> standard so that its property changes can be followed by the
 * classic {@code add/removePropertyChangeListener} methods since Jspresso
 * binding architecture leverages this behaviour. Jspresso managed components
 * implement it automatically but the developer must ensure it for other types
 * of components.
