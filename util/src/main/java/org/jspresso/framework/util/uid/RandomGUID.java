 * 11/05/02 -- Performance enhancement from Mike Dubman.
 *             Moved InetAddr.getLocal to static block.  Mike has measured
 *             a 10 fold improvement in run time.
 * 01/29/02 -- Bug fix: Improper seeding of nonsecure Random object
 *             caused duplicate GUIDs to be produced.  Random object
 *             is now only created once per JVM.
 * 01/19/02 -- Modified random seeding and added new constructor
 *             to allow secure random feature.
 * 01/14/02 -- Added random function seeding with JVM run time

/**
 * In the multitude of java GUID generators, I found none that guaranteed
 * randomness. GUIDs are guaranteed to be globally unique by using ethernet
 * MACs, IP addresses, time elements, and sequential numbers. GUIDs are not
 * expected to be random and most often are easy/possible to guess given a
 * sample from a given generator. SQL Server, for example generates GUID that
 * are unique but sequential within a given instance.
 * <p>
 * GUIDs can be used as security devices to hide things such as files within a
 * filesystem where listings are unavailable (e.g. files that are served up from
 * a Web server with indexing turned off). This may be desirable in cases where
 * standard authentication is not appropriate. In this scenario, the RandomGUIDs
 * are used as directories. Another example is the use of GUIDs for primary keys
 * in a database where you want to ensure that the keys are secret. Random GUIDs
 * can then be used in a URL to prevent hackers (or users) from accessing
 * records by guessing or simply by incrementing sequential numbers.
 * <p>
 * There are many other possibilities of using GUIDs in the realm of security and
 * encryption where the element of randomness is important. This class was
 * written for these purposes but can also be used as a general purpose GUID
 * generator as well.
 * <p>
 * RandomGUID generates truly random GUIDs by using the system's IP address
 * (name/IP), system time in milliseconds (as an integer), and a very large
 * random number joined together in a single String that is passed through an
 * MD5 hash. The IP address and system time make the MD5 seed globally unique
 * and the random number guarantees that the generated GUIDs will have no
 * discernable pattern and cannot be guessed given any number of previously
 * generated GUIDs. It is generally not possible to access the seed information
 * (IP, time, random number) from the resulting GUIDs as the MD5 hash algorithm
 * provides one way encryption.
 * <p>
 * ----> Security of RandomGUID: <----- RandomGUID can be called one of two ways
 * -- with the basic java Random number generator or a cryptographically strong
 * random generator (SecureRandom). The choice is offered because the secure
 * random generator takes about 3.5 times longer to generate its random numbers
 * and this performance hit may not be worth the added security especially
 * considering the basic generator is seeded with a cryptographically strong
 * random seed.
 * <p>
 * Seeding the basic generator in this way effectively decouples the random
 * numbers from the time component making it virtually impossible to predict the
 * random number component even if one had absolute knowledge of the System
 * time. Thanks to Ashutosh Narhari for the suggestion of using the static
 * method to prime the basic random generator.
 * <p>
 * Using the secure random option, this class compiles with the statistical
 * random number generator tests specified in FIPS 140-2, Security Requirements
 * for Cryptographic Modules, section 4.9.1.
 * <p>
 * I converted all the pieces of the seed to a String before handing it over to
 * the MD5 hash so that you could print it out to make sure it contains the data
 * you expect to see and to give a nice warm fuzzy. If you need better
 * performance, you may want to stick to byte[] arrays.
 * <p>
 * I believe that it is important that the algorithm for generating random GUIDs
 * be open for inspection and modification. This class is free for all uses.
