 * This descriptor is used to describe a collection of sibling nodes that only
 * nest a single subtree. The child subtree is directly placed under each node
 * without any intermediary grouping node. For instance, given a simple tree
 * level mapping a collection of <i>A</i>s and whose child is a tree level
 * mapping a collection of <i>B</i>s, the tree would look like :
 * 
 * <pre>
 * parent
 *   <b>A</b>-1
 *     <b>B</b>-1.1

 *     <b>B</b>-1.3
