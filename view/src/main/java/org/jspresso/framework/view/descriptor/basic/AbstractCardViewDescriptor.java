/**
 * This descriptor serves as abstract base implementation for card view
 * descriptor. A card view is a view stack made of children views (the cards)
 * where only the view (card) at the top of the stack is visible. The actual
 * child view to place on the top of the stack is dynamically determined based
 * on the bound model. This card determination strategy depends on the concrete
 * descriptor sub-types.
 * <p>
 * One might wonder why a card view is not considered as (and actually does not
 * inherit from) a composite view. The difference is that composite views are
 * used aggregate views that displays - hopefully - different parts (the children
 * views) of the <b>same</b> model. A card view descriptor is rather used to
 * make the same UI region display different views depending on different models
 * (or different model states). Once the model is fixed, the card view behaves
 * exactly as its top card.
 * <p>
 * One of the most important usage of card views is when it is combine as the
 * detail in a master-detail view. The detail view may then change dynamically
 * based on the selected master.
