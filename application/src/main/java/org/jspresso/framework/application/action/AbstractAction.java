/**
 * This is the base class for all application actions. It establishes the
 * foundation of the Jspresso action framework, i.e. each action can link :
 * <ul>
 * <li>a <i>wrapped</i> action that will execute a return back to the caller
 * action</li>
 * <li>a <i>next</i> action that will execute after the caller</li>
 * </ul>
 * The action chaining described above supports the separation of concerns that
 * consists in splitting the actions in two distinct categories :
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>frontend</i> actions that deal with user interaction. They are
 * typically used to bootstrap a service request from th UI, update the UI
 * state, trigger the display of information, errors, ...</li>
 * <li><i>backend</i> actions that are faceless, UI agnostic and deal with the
 * manipulation of the domain model, backend services, ...</li>
 * </ul>
 * Conceptually, a frontend action can call a backend action or another frontend
 * action but a backend action should stay on the backend, thus should only
 * reference another backend action. In other words, the backend layer should
 * never explicitly reference the frontend layer.
 * <p>
 * That's the main reason for having a <i>wrapped</i> and a <i>next</i> action
 * in the action chain. The <i>wrapped</i> action is perfectly suited to call
 * the backend layer (a backend action) and give the flow back to the frontend
 * layer. The <i>next</i> action is perfectly suited to chain 2 actions of the
 * same type (i.e. 2 frontend actions or 2 backend actions). Using this scheme
 * helps keeping layer dependencies clear. Of course, this dual chaining
 * mechanism is completely recursive thus allowing to compose small (generic)
 * actions into larger composite ones and promoting reusability.
 * <p>
 * Actions execute on a context (an arbitrary map of objects keyed by
 * "well-known" character strings) that is initialized by the controller when
 * the action is triggered. The context passes along the action chain and is
 * thus the perfect medium for actions to loosely communicate between each
 * other. There are some framework standard elements placed in the action
 * context that depend on the application state, but nothing prevents action
 * developers to synchronize on arbitrary custom context elements that would be
 * produced/consumed to/from the context.
 * <p>
 * Regarding framework-standard context elements, an action developer can
 * (should) leverage the utility methods declared in the
 * {@code AbstractActionContextAware} super class instead of relying on the
 * element keys in the map. Take a look to the
 * {@code AbstractActionContextAware} documentation to get your hands on
 * action context exploration.
 * <p>
 * Last but not least, you should be aware that actions should be coded with
 * thread-safety in mind. Actual action instances are generally singleton-like
 * (unless explicitly stated which is extremely rare) and thus, might be used by
 * multiple sessions (threads) at once. You should <b>never</b> use action class
 * attributes for argument passing along the action chain, but use the
 * thread-owned action execution context instead. The action context is a data
 * structure that is local to an action chain execution thus not shared across
 * threads (users). It is the perfect place for exchanging data between actions.
 * Of course, different instances of the same action can be used and configured
 * differently through their class attributes (refer to it as static
 * configuration), but this is all for using in different places in the
 * application.
